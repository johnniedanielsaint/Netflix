Netflix Userbase Dataset
Sample Netflix User Data: Subscription Types, Revenue, User Details, and Activity

About Dataset
The dataset provides a snapshot of a sample Netflix userbase, showcasing various aspects of user subscriptions, revenue, account details, and activity. Each row represents a unique user, identified by their User ID. The dataset includes information such as the user's subscription type (Basic, Standard, or Premium), the monthly revenue generated from their subscription, the date they joined Netflix (Join Date), the date of their last payment (Last Payment Date), and the country in which they are located.
Additional columns have been included to provide insights into user behavior and preferences. These columns include Device Type (e.g., Smart TV, Mobile, Desktop, Tablet) and Account Status (whether the account is active or not). The dataset serves as a synthetic representation and does not reflect actual Netflix user data. It can be used for analysis and modeling to understand user trends, preferences, and revenue generation within a hypothetical Netflix userbase.

I've recently conducted an in-depth analysis of Netflix's revenue and subscription trends. Here are the key insights:
1. Revenue Insights
â€¢	Monthly Revenue by Subscription Type: The Premium plan consistently contributes the highest revenue, with significant peaks during the holiday season.
â€¢	Country-wise Revenue: The U.S., Canada, and the U.K. are the top revenue-generating countries, but there's potential for growth in emerging markets.
â€¢	Revenue by Age Group: Subscribers aged 25-34 contribute the most to the revenue, indicating a strong millennial user base.
â€¢	Gender by Monthly Revenue: There's a nearly equal revenue contribution from male and female subscribers, with slight variations during new content releases.
2. Subscription & Payment Trends
â€¢	Join Date Trends: Subscription spikes are evident during major content releases and holiday periods, highlighting the importance of timely marketing campaigns.
â€¢	Payment Date Patterns: Most payments are processed around the 1st of each month, with consistent patterns across all subscription types.
â€¢	Plan Duration Analysis: The Premium plan shows the highest retention rates, with many users upgrading from the Basic plan within the first 6 months.
